These files describe a set of acceptance tests for the sailfish-office application.

Each file describes related scenarios with a number of steps to complete each scenario.

The format is as follows:

Goal: <A short description of the goal of the scenario>
Initial Conditions: <A list of initial conditions that apply, with an optional reference
    to a different test file in braces>
Steps: <A list of steps to reach the goal of the scenario>
    Step: <A single step on the way to reach the goal>
        Action: <The action taken for this step>
        Result: <The result of the step>

Note that if any of the results of a step do not match the expectations, the step fails
and thus the scenario fails.
